I'm currently a Senior Data Scientist at Geisinger, as a part of the Steele Institute for Health Innovation. 

I recently graduated from Columbia University with a  PhD in Biomedical Informatics, working with Dr. Lena Mamykina, where my dissertation research was at the intersection of data science and human computer interaction in health. 

Previously, I worked in technical services at Epic in Madison, WI, and studied Psychology and Cognitive Science at Carleton College in Northfield, MN.
